# Chapter 6 — The Hydrogen Atom


## TL;DR

- One electron, one proton, a Coulomb potential. Before you read on, ask yourself: why would the simplest atom be the one that decides whether quantum mechanics is right?
- Watch for the turns: central potential and separation of variables, the 1s solution and where the numbers actually come from, the dismantling of the orbit picture, and the hidden symmetry behind Bohr's lucky success.
- Read it for the main argument, the vocabulary it introduces, and the practical judgment it asks you to develop.

*One electron, one proton, a Coulomb potential — and the cleanest test we have of whether quantum mechanics is right about the world.*

Start with a puzzle that took physics twenty-eight years to solve. In 1885 a Swiss schoolteacher named Johann Balmer was staring at hydrogen's emission spectrum — the handful of sharp colored lines that hydrogen produces when you heat it in a discharge tube — and noticed that their wavelengths fit a formula. Here is the question worth holding onto: if you found a clean numerical pattern in data, with no physical principle behind it, would you trust it? Balmer did not derive it from anything. He just looked:

$$\lambda_n = B \cdot \frac{n^2}{n^2 - 4}, \qquad n = 3, 4, 5, \ldots$$

with $B \approx 364.5$ nm. [Balmer 1885, *Annalen der Physik* 261, 80–87](https://doi.org/10.1002/andp.18852610506) [verify]. He published it and moved on. The formula worked, and nobody knew why. That gap — a formula that works for no known reason — is exactly the kind of thing that should make you uneasy.

Twenty-eight years passed.

Then in 1913 Niels Bohr published a derivation. [Bohr 1913, *Philosophical Magazine* Series 6, 26, 1–25](https://doi.org/10.1080/14786441308634955). His postulate was stark: the electron orbits the proton in circles, but only certain circles are allowed — the ones where the angular momentum is an integer multiple of $\hbar$. With that one rule and Newton's second law for circular motion under the Coulomb force, Balmer's formula fell out with the right numerical coefficient. The energy levels were

$$E_n = -\frac{13.6\,\text{eV}}{n^2}.$$

The red line at 656 nm, the blue-green at 486 nm, the violet at 434 nm — all there, all correct.

*Figure 6.1 — Hydrogen emission spectrum in the visible range *

Now a harder question. A model gets the energies exactly right. Does that mean the model is true? Most people, faced with a theory that nails the numbers, conclude the picture behind it must be correct. That is almost the right instinct — and it is precisely where it breaks. Bohr's electron traces a definite circular path at a definite radius. That picture, as we now know, is false. And yet the energies are right.

How can a wrong picture produce right numbers? Sit with that tension for a moment, because the whole chapter is the answer to it. The short version: the Coulomb potential $V \propto 1/r$ has a hidden symmetry — beyond the obvious rotational symmetry — that forces all states with the same $n$ to have the same energy regardless of how they actually behave. Bohr stumbled onto a consequence of that symmetry without knowing it existed. And here is the tell that it was luck rather than insight: the accident only works for hydrogen. Apply Bohr's method to helium and it fails by 30%.
<!-- FACT-CHECK FLAG: UNVERIFIED — see factchecks/06-the-hydrogen-atom-assertions.md (specific 30% figure should be sourced; magnitude correct ~30–40%) -->
 The deep-dive of this chapter is: solve hydrogen properly, show where $a_0$ and $-13.6\,\text{eV}$ actually come from, and use the exact solution to dismantle the picture of the electron as an orbiting particle.

## The setup: central potential, separation of variables

The Hamiltonian for one electron bound to one proton is

$$\hat{H} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m_e}\nabla^2 - \frac{e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 r}.$$

Look hard at that potential before going further. What does it depend on, and what does it ignore? It depends only on $r$ — the distance from the proton — and not on direction at all. Why should that single feature matter so much? Because it is exactly the property that licenses a strategy: a potential that looks the same from every direction is called a *central potential*, and a central potential gives us permission to use spherical coordinates and separate the Schrödinger equation into a radial piece and an angular piece.

Assume $\psi(r,\theta,\phi) = R(r) \cdot Y(\theta,\phi)$ and substitute into $\hat{H}\psi = E\psi$. The angular part separates out as an eigenvalue equation for the operator $\hat{L}^2/\hbar^2$ on the sphere. Its solutions are the spherical harmonics $Y_{\ell m}(\theta,\phi)$, which Unit 7 derives. Here we will use the result: they exist, they are labeled by two integers $\ell \geq 0$ and $-\ell \leq m \leq \ell$, and they are orthonormal on the sphere. For the $1s$ state, $\ell = 0$, and the one spherical harmonic with $\ell = 0$ is the constant $Y_{00} = 1/\sqrt{4\pi}$.

The radial equation, with the substitution $u(r) = rR(r)$ that converts it into a one-dimensional problem, is

$$-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m_e}\frac{d^2u}{dr^2} + \left[-\frac{e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 r} + \frac{\hbar^2\ell(\ell+1)}{2m_e r^2}\right]u = Eu.$$

There is a term in that bracket that did not appear in the Hamiltonian you started with. Where did $\hbar^2\ell(\ell+1)/(2m_e r^2)$ come from? Not from any classical assumption about orbits — it emerged automatically from the separation itself. This is the *centrifugal barrier*. Ask what it does physically: for electrons with $\ell > 0$, this repulsive $1/r^2$ term keeps them away from the nucleus. And for $\ell = 0$? It is simply absent, and the electron is free to have significant probability near $r = 0$. Hold that distinction; it will matter when we ask where the electron actually is.

For the $1s$ state ($\ell = 0$), the radial equation is

$$-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m_e}\frac{d^2u}{dr^2} - \frac{e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 r}u = Eu.$$

## Solving the 1s state: where the numbers come from

Here is the move that decides everything, and it is worth asking why it is allowed before we make it. We *guess* the form of the answer. Try the ansatz $u(r) = Ar\,e^{-r/a}$, with $A$ a normalization constant and $a$ a length scale to be determined. Why a factor of $r$ out front? Because $R(r) = u(r)/r$ must be finite at the origin, so $u(0) = 0$. Why the decaying exponential? Because a bound electron's wave function must be normalizable, and that demands it fall off at large $r$. The guess is not arbitrary; each piece of it answers a physical requirement.

Differentiate twice:

$$\frac{du}{dr} = Ae^{-r/a}\!\left(1 - \frac{r}{a}\right), \qquad \frac{d^2u}{dr^2} = Ae^{-r/a}\!\left(-\frac{2}{a} + \frac{r}{a^2}\right).$$

Substitute into the radial equation and divide through by $Ae^{-r/a}$:

$$\frac{\hbar^2}{m_e a} - \frac{\hbar^2 r}{2m_e a^2} - \frac{e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} = Er.$$

Now sort by powers of $r$. The constant terms and the $r$-linear terms must each be independently zero (one equation for two unknowns, but the equation has to hold for all $r$):

**Constant terms:**
$$\frac{\hbar^2}{m_e a} = \frac{e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \implies a = \frac{4\pi\varepsilon_0\hbar^2}{m_e e^2} \equiv a_0.$$

**Linear-in-$r$ terms:**
$$E = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m_e a_0^2}.$$

Plugging in numbers: $E_1 \approx -13.6\,\text{eV}$.

Now stop and notice what just happened, because it is the heart of the chapter. The Bohr radius $a_0 \approx 5.29 \times 10^{-11}$ m and the ionization energy $13.6\,\text{eV}$ come directly out of matching the constant and linear pieces of the equation. Did we postulate a quantization condition? No. Did we assume circular orbits? No. The ansatz $u \propto re^{-r/a}$ was the only guess, and it is self-consistent only when $a = a_0$ and $E = E_1$. The numbers Bohr had to put in by hand fall out here for free, as the price of consistency.

Normalize. The full wave function is $\psi_{100} = R_{10}(r) \cdot Y_{00}$, with $R_{10}(r) = Ae^{-r/a_0}$ and $Y_{00} = 1/\sqrt{4\pi}$. The normalization condition $\int|\psi|^2 d^3r = 1$ separates:

$$\int_0^\infty |R_{10}|^2 r^2\,dr \cdot \int |Y_{00}|^2\,d\Omega = 1.$$

The angular integral is 1. The radial integral gives $A = 2/a_0^{3/2}$. The normalized ground-state wave function is:

$$\boxed{\psi_{100}(r) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi a_0^3}}\,e^{-r/a_0}.}$$

## Dismantling the orbit picture

Here is where the Bohr model breaks — and I want you to predict where, before I show you. Bohr got the energy right. So what does his model get wrong? Everything it says about *where the electron is*. Let us prove it with two numbers that ought to agree if the orbit picture were true, and then watch them disagree.

The *radial probability density* — the probability of finding the electron in a thin spherical shell of radius $r$ and thickness $dr$ — is

$$P(r) = |R_{10}(r)|^2 \cdot r^2 = \frac{4}{a_0^3}\,r^2 e^{-2r/a_0}.$$

Why the factor $r^2$? It is the Jacobian from spherical coordinates: there is more volume at larger $r$, so a spherical shell of fixed thickness $dr$ is larger the further out you go. That geometric factor competes with the decaying exponential — one pushing outward, one pulling inward. Where do they balance?

Maximize $P(r)$:

$$\frac{dP}{dr} = \frac{4}{a_0^3}\left(2r - \frac{2r^2}{a_0}\right)e^{-2r/a_0} = 0 \implies r_{\text{mp}} = a_0.$$

The most probable radius is $a_0$. Bohr got this right. Now, before reading on, predict the *average* distance. If you said "also $a_0$" — that is the natural guess, and it is where the orbit picture quietly fails. Compute the *expectation value* of $r$:

$$\langle r\rangle = \frac{4}{a_0^3}\int_0^\infty r^3 e^{-2r/a_0}\,dr = \frac{4}{a_0^3} \cdot \frac{6}{(2/a_0)^4} = \frac{3a_0}{2}.$$

The most probable radius is $a_0$. The average radius is $\tfrac{3}{2}a_0$.

So they are *not* the same number. Why not? Because the distribution is asymmetric: $P(r)$ peaks at $a_0$ but has a long tail toward larger $r$, and that tail pulls the average upward. Now ask what would have to be true for the two numbers to coincide. If the electron were on a circular orbit at radius $a_0$, there would be exactly one radius, and "most probable" and "average" would both equal $a_0$. They differ. That difference is the mathematical signature that the electron occupies a distribution of radii, not a single one. There is no orbit. There is a probability cloud.

![The orbit picture requires both markers to be at the same place. They are not.](../images/06-the-hydrogen-atom-fig-04.png)
*Figure 6.4 — P(r) = (4/a₀³)r²e^{−2r/a₀} plotted vs r/a₀ from 0*

Push the dismantling one step further. Is there any moment at which the electron is at a definite radius, moving at a definite speed, in a definite direction? No. What exists is $|\psi_{100}|^2$ — a spherically symmetric cloud that falls off exponentially from the nucleus. The quantity $a_0$ appears in that cloud as the length scale. So what exactly did Bohr find? He found the right length scale by assuming a circular orbit. He got lucky: the length scale is real, the orbit is not.

---

## Why Bohr got the energies right: the hidden symmetry

We have called Bohr's success an accident three times now. But is it really an accident, or is there a reason it had to work? Ask the sharper question: what property of the $1/r$ potential could force every state with the same $n$ to share an energy, no matter how differently those states behave?

The Coulomb potential $V = -e^2/(4\pi\varepsilon_0 r)$ has more symmetry than is obvious. Beyond the rotational symmetry $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ (the potential looks the same from all directions), the $1/r$ potential has a second conserved quantity: the Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector, which points along the major axis of the classical elliptical orbit and has constant magnitude. The combined symmetry group of the Coulomb problem is $\mathrm{SO}(4)$.

Wolfgang Pauli used this symmetry in early 1926 to solve hydrogen algebraically, before Schrödinger's wave-mechanical solution appeared. [Pauli 1926, *Zeitschrift für Physik* 36, 336–363](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01450175) [verify pages]. The consequence of $\mathrm{SO}(4)$ is that the energy of a hydrogen state depends only on the principal quantum number $n$, not on $\ell$. States with the same $n$ but different $\ell$ — $2s$ and $2p$, for instance — have exactly the same energy. This is called *accidental degeneracy* — and now you can see why that name is misleading. It is not accidental at all. It is forced by the symmetry.

So return to Bohr's quantization condition $L = n\hbar$. Is it correct about angular momentum? No — the actual eigenvalue of $\hat{L}^2$ is $\hbar^2\ell(\ell+1)$, and $\ell$ can be anywhere from $0$ to $n-1$. Then how did his energy formula survive being wrong about angular momentum? Because energy depends only on $n$ and not on $\ell$, so being wrong about $\ell$ costs him nothing in the energies. His formula is accidentally correct. And the test of that diagnosis: apply his method to helium — two electrons, no clean $\mathrm{SO}(4)$ symmetry, no accidental degeneracy — and the model fails by about 30%. The success was always hydrogen-specific.

## The four quantum numbers

Every hydrogen state is labeled by four quantum numbers. As you read them, ask in each case: what physical question does this number answer, and what operator is it the eigenvalue label for?

The *principal quantum number* $n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$ sets the energy: $E_n = -13.6\,\text{eV}/n^2$. It is the eigenvalue label for $\hat{H}$.

The *orbital angular momentum quantum number* $\ell = 0, 1, \ldots, n-1$ sets the magnitude of the orbital angular momentum: $\hat{L}^2\psi = \hbar^2\ell(\ell+1)\psi$. The spectroscopic letters $s, p, d, f$ label $\ell = 0, 1, 2, 3$ respectively — inherited from pre-quantum spectroscopy ("sharp, principal, diffuse, fundamental") and kept purely by convention.

The *magnetic quantum number* $m_\ell = -\ell, -\ell+1, \ldots, +\ell$ sets the projection of orbital angular momentum onto a chosen axis: $\hat{L}_z\psi = m_\ell\hbar\psi$.

The *spin quantum number* $m_s = \pm 1/2$ sets the projection of spin angular momentum: $\hat{S}_z\psi = m_s\hbar\psi$.

The total number of states at energy level $n$ is

$$\sum_{\ell=0}^{n-1}(2\ell+1) = n^2 \quad\text{(without spin)}, \qquad 2n^2 \quad\text{(with spin)}.$$

Now ask why that particular count, $n^2$, and not some other. It is a direct consequence of the $\mathrm{SO}(4)$ degeneracy — the same hidden symmetry from the previous section, showing up again. Count the consequences: the shell at $n=1$ holds 2 electrons; at $n=2$, 8; at $n=3$, 18. Do those numbers look familiar? They are the row capacities of the periodic table — imposed by quantum mechanics and Pauli, not by chemistry.

| $n$ | $\ell$ values | spectroscopic labels | $m_\ell$ values | orbitals | states with spin |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 0 | 1s | 0 | 1 | 2 |
| 2 | 0, 1 | 2s, 2p | 0; -1, 0, +1 | 4 | 8 |
| 3 | 0, 1, 2 | 3s, 3p, 3d | 0; -1, 0, +1; -2, -1, 0, +1, +2 | 9 | 18 |
| 4 | 0, 1, 2, 3 | 4s, 4p, 4d, 4f | $m_\ell=-\ell,\ldots,+\ell$ | 16 | 32 |

One name correction worth catching before it traps you. The word "orbital" sounds like "orbit" — does it mean the same thing? It does not. An orbital — the spherical $s$ cloud, the dumbbell $p$, the four-lobed $d$ — is an isocontour of $|\psi_{n\ell m}|^2$, usually drawn at the surface that encloses 90% of the probability. It describes where the electron is *likely to be found if measured*. It does not describe what the electron is doing between measurements. There is no between-measurements story that quantum mechanics tells. The orbital shape is everything; the trajectory is nothing.

## Spin: the internal angular momentum that cannot be rotation

In 1922 Otto Stern and Walther Gerlach sent a beam of neutral silver atoms through an inhomogeneous magnetic field. Before you read what they saw, predict it. If atoms have magnetic moments pointing in all directions, classically, what pattern should appear on the detector — a smear, or something else? Classically, the moments at all orientations should smear continuously across the detector. What they actually saw was two discrete spots. [Stern & Gerlach 1922, *Zeitschrift für Physik* 9, 349–352](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01326983) [verify pages].

Two spots, not a smear. What could force a continuous classical expectation into exactly two outcomes? Silver has one unpaired electron in a $5s$ state. The two spots correspond to the two projections of that electron's spin onto the magnetic-field axis: $S_z = +\hbar/2$ and $S_z = -\hbar/2$. Two outcomes, not a continuum.

![Two spots where classical physics predicts a smear. The discreteness is spin.](../images/06-the-hydrogen-atom-fig-06.png)
*Figure 6.6 — Stern-Gerlach apparatus diagram *

There is a historical twist worth dwelling on, because it shows how an experiment can outrun its own interpretation. Did Stern and Gerlach in 1922 know they were seeing electron spin? They did not — spin had not been proposed. They thought they were seeing "space quantization" of orbital angular momentum. The correct interpretation — that the splitting comes from the spin of the unpaired $5s$ electron — came only after Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit proposed the idea of intrinsic electron spin in 1925. [Uhlenbeck & Goudsmit 1925, *Die Naturwissenschaften* 13, 953–954](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01558878) [verify]. The experiment ran three years before anyone knew what it was measuring.

So what is spin? Here is the trap to avoid: the word invites you to picture something rotating. Resist that for now and take the operational definition first. Spin is intrinsic angular momentum. Every electron carries angular momentum of magnitude $\sqrt{s(s+1)}\hbar = (\sqrt{3}/2)\hbar$ with $s = 1/2$, full stop. It is not angular momentum from motion through space. It is a property the electron has the way it has charge or mass. Where does such a thing come from? The Dirac equation — the relativistic version of the Schrödinger equation — produces spin automatically: if you demand a quantum wave equation be Lorentz-invariant, spin-1/2 falls out as an algebraic necessity. [Dirac 1928, *Proceedings of the Royal Society A* 117, 610–624](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspa.1928.0023). You do not have to put spin in; you cannot keep it out.

Now confront the picture you were told to resist. Why *can't* the electron be a tiny spinning ball? This is the kind of claim you should not accept or reject on intuition — you should test it with a number. Suppose the electron is a uniform solid sphere of radius $r_e$ rotating about its axis. For a solid sphere, $I = \frac{2}{5}m_er_e^2$, so for the angular momentum to equal $\hbar/2$, the equatorial speed would need to be

$$v = \omega r_e = \frac{Lr_e}{I} = \frac{5\hbar}{4m_e r_e}.$$

The classical electron radius — estimated by setting the electron's rest-mass energy equal to its electrostatic self-energy — is $r_e \approx 2.82 \times 10^{-15}$ m. Plugging in:

$$v \approx \frac{5(1.055\times10^{-34})}{4(9.11\times10^{-31})(2.82\times10^{-15})} \approx 5.1 \times 10^{10}\,\text{m/s}.$$

Look at that speed against the speed of light. It is roughly 170 times $c$, matching the solid-sphere estimate used in the reference spin chapter. And it gets worse, not better: if the electron is smaller than $r_e$ — and experiment constrains it to be pointlike down to at least $10^{-18}$ m — the required speed becomes astronomically larger. So the classical spinning-ball picture is not just imprecise. It is geometrically impossible.

Then why does the picture survive at all? Because it is convenient shorthand, and convenient shorthand is hard to retire. The calculation above should be enough to do it.

## The Pauli exclusion principle

In 1925, before the Schrödinger equation existed, Pauli proposed that no two electrons in an atom can have all four quantum numbers $(n, \ell, m_\ell, m_s)$ the same. [Pauli 1925, *Zeitschrift für Physik* 31, 765–783](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02980631). How does someone discover a rule like that without a theory underneath it? The same way Balmer found his formula — by studying patterns. Pauli studied the patterns in atomic spectra: which shells fill with how many electrons, what rules determine which spectral lines exist. The rule fit all the data. He did not yet know why.

So ask the why. The deeper explanation, which Unit 8 develops, is that electrons are fermions: their multi-particle wave function must be antisymmetric under exchange of any two particles, $\psi(1,2) = -\psi(2,1)$. Now run the consequence. If two electrons occupied the same state, what would the wave function have to equal? Its own negative — and the only number that equals its own negative is zero. So no such state exists. The exclusion principle is a corollary, not a separate postulate. Here we only need the consequence: each orbital, labeled by $(n, \ell, m_\ell)$, holds at most two electrons — one spin-up and one spin-down.

The $n=1$ shell has $2(1)^2 = 2$ states. The $n=2$ shell has $2(2)^2 = 8$. The $n=3$ shell has $2(3)^2 = 18$. This is the row structure of the periodic table.

Now the claim that should sound too large to be true. What does the exclusion principle actually hold up in the everyday world? The reason solid matter takes up space, the reason your hand does not pass through the table, the reason atoms have size — all of it traces to Pauli. Run the counterfactual to feel the weight of it: without the exclusion principle, every electron in every atom would pile into the $1s$ ground state, and every atom would be the size of hydrogen. Chemistry would not exist. So the exclusion principle is, in a precise sense, the principle that the material world is made of solid objects rather than collapsing blobs.

## What would change my mind

Hydrogen spectroscopy is quantum mechanics' best-tested prediction. Every refinement has added confirmation: the Lamb shift from quantum electrodynamics, the hyperfine structure from nuclear spin, the fine structure from relativistic corrections — all computed, all measured, all agreed. The "proton radius puzzle" — a discrepancy between the proton radius inferred from muonic hydrogen [Pohl et al. 2010, *Nature* 466, 213–216](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature09250) and from ordinary electron-hydrogen spectroscopy — appeared threatening for a few years, but more recent measurements [Bezginov et al. 2019, *Science* 365, 1007–1012](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aau7807) [verify] are converging toward the smaller muonic value. The framework holds. What would shake it: a hydrogen spectral line that no extension of the current theory can fit, persistently and reproducibly. We do not have one.

## Still puzzling

The $\mathrm{SO}(4)$ symmetry of the Coulomb potential — the hidden symmetry that makes hydrogen's energy depend only on $n$, not on $\ell$ — feels like a coincidence even though it is mathematically forced by the $1/r$ form of the potential. Pauli's 1926 derivation makes the algebra explicit and clean. It does not make the symmetry feel inevitable. Why does the inverse-square law have this extra conserved quantity while, say, a $1/r^2$ potential does not? There is a clean answer in classical mechanics — Bertrand's theorem, which says the only potentials producing closed orbits are $1/r$ and $r^2$ — and a corresponding quantum-mechanical answer involving the Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector. I find both explanations technically correct and somehow aesthetically unsatisfying. The fact that hydrogen, and only hydrogen among the one-electron atoms, is cleanly soluble feels like a coincidence with a deep reason rather than a deep reason I fully understand.
