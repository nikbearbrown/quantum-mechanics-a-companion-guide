# Chapter 7 — Angular Momentum
*One Commutation Relation. One Derivation. Every Eigenvalue You'll Ever Need.*

---

A student asks the right question in office hours. She says: the letter $\ell$ shows up in three places. It is the eigenvalue of $\hat{L}^2$ — well, with a $(\ell+1)$ factor she does not understand. It is the label on the state. And it determines the range of $m_\ell$ from $-\ell$ to $+\ell$. Why is the same letter doing three jobs? Where does any of this come from?

She is right to be suspicious. Most introductory texts present $\hat{L}^2 \psi = \hbar^2\ell(\ell+1)\psi$ as if it descended from a mountain. The $(\ell+1)$ looks like an arbitrary correction — a coincidence that happens to fit. The fact that $|m_\ell| \leq \ell$ looks like a coincidence too. The whole apparatus floats free of any derivation, and students absorb it as a table to memorize.

It does not have to be that way. The entire spectrum follows from one fact and two requirements. The fact: the components of angular momentum do not commute, $[\hat{L}_x, \hat{L}_y] = i\hbar \hat{L}_z$. The requirements: physical operators have real expectation values, and the spectrum of $\hat{L}_z$ must be bounded in any finite-norm state. Run those constraints through the algebra of two auxiliary operators, and every eigenvalue falls out. No spatial integration. No differential equations. Pure algebra.

Once that is in hand, spin is just a question of which representation of the same algebra you are using. The $(\ell+1)$ factor will no longer look arbitrary. It will look like the only thing it could possibly be.

## The commutation relations

Classical angular momentum is $\vec{L} = \vec{r} \times \vec{p}$. In components:

$$L_x = yp_z - zp_y, \quad L_y = zp_x - xp_z, \quad L_z = xp_y - yp_x.$$

Promote each variable to an operator. The canonical commutator $[\hat{x}_i, \hat{p}_j] = i\hbar\delta_{ij}$ — with $[\hat{x}_i, \hat{x}_j] = [\hat{p}_i, \hat{p}_j] = 0$ — gives the angular momentum components non-trivial commutators among themselves.

Let us run $[\hat{L}_x, \hat{L}_y]$ explicitly, because it is the cornerstone and almost no student has actually done the calculation.

$$[\hat{L}_x, \hat{L}_y] = [\hat{y}\hat{p}_z - \hat{z}\hat{p}_y,\; \hat{z}\hat{p}_x - \hat{x}\hat{p}_z].$$

Expand using bilinearity. Most of the four terms vanish because the only non-commuting pairs are $[\hat{x}_i, \hat{p}_i] = i\hbar$. Working through what survives:

- $[\hat{y}\hat{p}_z, \hat{z}\hat{p}_x] = \hat{y}[\hat{p}_z, \hat{z}]\hat{p}_x = \hat{y}(-i\hbar)\hat{p}_x = -i\hbar\,\hat{y}\hat{p}_x.$
- $[\hat{y}\hat{p}_z, \hat{x}\hat{p}_z] = 0$ (no shared index).
- $[\hat{z}\hat{p}_y, \hat{z}\hat{p}_x] = 0$ (likewise).
- $[\hat{z}\hat{p}_y, \hat{x}\hat{p}_z] = [\hat{z}, \hat{p}_z]\hat{p}_y\hat{x} = (i\hbar)\hat{p}_y\hat{x} = i\hbar\,\hat{x}\hat{p}_y.$

Sum:

$$[\hat{L}_x, \hat{L}_y] = -i\hbar\,\hat{y}\hat{p}_x + i\hbar\,\hat{x}\hat{p}_y = i\hbar(\hat{x}\hat{p}_y - \hat{y}\hat{p}_x) = i\hbar\hat{L}_z.$$

Cyclically, the same calculation gives $[\hat{L}_y, \hat{L}_z] = i\hbar\hat{L}_x$ and $[\hat{L}_z, \hat{L}_x] = i\hbar\hat{L}_y$. These three relations together are the *defining relations* of an angular-momentum algebra. Any three operators satisfying this Lie-bracket structure deserve to be called angular momentum components — whether they came from $\vec{r}\times\vec{p}$ or somewhere else entirely. That "somewhere else" is spin.

One immediate consequence. The operator $\hat{L}^2 = \hat{L}_x^2 + \hat{L}_y^2 + \hat{L}_z^2$ commutes with every component. The proof for $\hat{L}_z$:

$$[\hat{L}^2, \hat{L}_z] = [\hat{L}_x^2, \hat{L}_z] + [\hat{L}_y^2, \hat{L}_z] + [\hat{L}_z^2, \hat{L}_z].$$

The last term vanishes. For the first, $[\hat{L}_x^2, \hat{L}_z] = \hat{L}_x[\hat{L}_x, \hat{L}_z] + [\hat{L}_x, \hat{L}_z]\hat{L}_x = -i\hbar(\hat{L}_x\hat{L}_y + \hat{L}_y\hat{L}_x)$. For the second, $[\hat{L}_y^2, \hat{L}_z] = +i\hbar(\hat{L}_y\hat{L}_x + \hat{L}_x\hat{L}_y)$. They cancel exactly. So $[\hat{L}^2, \hat{L}_z] = 0$, which means $\hat{L}^2$ and $\hat{L}_z$ can be simultaneously diagonalized.

Label their common eigenstates $|\ell, m\rangle$, with

$$\hat{L}^2 |\ell, m\rangle = \lambda |\ell, m\rangle, \quad \hat{L}_z |\ell, m\rangle = m\hbar |\ell, m\rangle.$$

We have not yet shown that $\lambda = \hbar^2\ell(\ell+1)$ or that $m$ is bounded. That is the next two pages.

## The ladder operators and the spectrum

Define

$$\hat{L}_\pm = \hat{L}_x \pm i\hat{L}_y.$$

These are not Hermitian — they are each other's adjoints, $\hat{L}_+^\dagger = \hat{L}_-$ — so they are not observables. They are tools. From the commutation relations:

$$[\hat{L}_z, \hat{L}_\pm] = \pm\hbar\hat{L}_\pm, \qquad [\hat{L}^2, \hat{L}_\pm] = 0.$$

The second relation says $\hat{L}_\pm$ does not change the $\hat{L}^2$ eigenvalue. The first says it shifts the $\hat{L}_z$ eigenvalue. Specifically: if $\hat{L}_z|\ell, m\rangle = m\hbar|\ell, m\rangle$, then

$$\hat{L}_z(\hat{L}_+|\ell, m\rangle) = (\hat{L}_+\hat{L}_z + \hbar\hat{L}_+)|\ell, m\rangle = (m+1)\hbar\cdot\hat{L}_+|\ell, m\rangle.$$

So $\hat{L}_+|\ell, m\rangle$ is an eigenstate of $\hat{L}_z$ with eigenvalue $(m+1)\hbar$. The raising operator climbs the ladder of $m$-values one rung at a time, staying at the same $\hat{L}^2$ eigenvalue throughout. The lowering operator $\hat{L}_-$ descends by one rung.

![Ladder diagram showing m-values from −ℓ to +ℓ](images/07-angular-momentum-fig-01.png)
*Figure 7.1 — Ladder diagram showing m-values from −ℓ to +ℓ*

The ladder cannot extend forever, because expectation values are bounded. The operator $\hat{L}^2 - \hat{L}_z^2 = \hat{L}_x^2 + \hat{L}_y^2$ is a sum of squared Hermitian operators, so its expectation value is non-negative in any state:

$$\langle \hat{L}_x^2 + \hat{L}_y^2 \rangle \geq 0.$$

In an eigenstate $|\ell, m\rangle$, this gives $\lambda - m^2\hbar^2 \geq 0$, so $m^2 \leq \lambda/\hbar^2$. The $m$-values are bounded. There must be a top rung $|\ell, m_{\max}\rangle$ that the raising operator annihilates, and a bottom rung $|\ell, m_{\min}\rangle$ that the lowering operator annihilates.

Now compute $\lambda$. There is a useful product identity:

$$\hat{L}_-\hat{L}_+ = (\hat{L}_x - i\hat{L}_y)(\hat{L}_x + i\hat{L}_y) = \hat{L}_x^2 + \hat{L}_y^2 + i[\hat{L}_x, \hat{L}_y] = \hat{L}^2 - \hat{L}_z^2 - \hbar\hat{L}_z.$$

Apply this to the top rung, where $\hat{L}_+|\ell, m_{\max}\rangle = 0$:

$$0 = \hat{L}_-\hat{L}_+|\ell, m_{\max}\rangle = (\hat{L}^2 - \hat{L}_z^2 - \hbar\hat{L}_z)|\ell, m_{\max}\rangle = (\lambda - m_{\max}^2\hbar^2 - m_{\max}\hbar^2)|\ell, m_{\max}\rangle.$$

So

$$\lambda = m_{\max}(m_{\max} + 1)\hbar^2.$$

Define $\ell \equiv m_{\max}$, and there it is:

$$\lambda = \hbar^2\ell(\ell+1).$$

The $(\ell+1)$ is not a correction. It comes from the cross-term $i[\hat{L}_x, \hat{L}_y] = -\hbar\hat{L}_z$ that appears when you expand $\hat{L}_-\hat{L}_+$. The non-commutativity of the components shows up, irreducibly, in the eigenvalue. If the components commuted, the eigenvalue would be $\ell^2\hbar^2$, not $\ell(\ell+1)\hbar^2$, and the bottom rung would be at $-\ell$ with no asymmetry. Because they do not commute, the algebra forces the asymmetry and the factor.

The same calculation on the bottom rung — using $\hat{L}_+\hat{L}_- = \hat{L}^2 - \hat{L}_z^2 + \hbar\hat{L}_z$ and $\hat{L}_-|\ell, m_{\min}\rangle = 0$ — gives $\lambda = m_{\min}(m_{\min}-1)\hbar^2$. Combined with $\lambda = \ell(\ell+1)\hbar^2$, the equation $m_{\min}(m_{\min}-1) = \ell(\ell+1)$ has solutions $m_{\min} = -\ell$ and $m_{\min} = \ell+1$. The second solution contradicts $m_{\min} \leq m_{\max} = \ell$, so $m_{\min} = -\ell$.

The ladder runs from $m = -\ell$ to $m = +\ell$ in unit steps. So $2\ell$ must be a non-negative integer, meaning $\ell \in \{0, \frac{1}{2}, 1, \frac{3}{2}, 2, \ldots\}$. The algebra allows both integers and half-integers. Which values are physically realized depends on what Hilbert space the operators act on.

## Spherical harmonics and why half-integers fail for orbital angular momentum

When $\hat{L}^2$ and $\hat{L}_z$ act on functions of $(\theta, \phi)$ on the sphere, their simultaneous eigenfunctions are the spherical harmonics $Y_{\ell m}(\theta, \phi)$. In spherical coordinates $\hat{L}_z = -i\hbar\partial/\partial\phi$, so the $\phi$-dependence of $Y_{\ell m}$ is $e^{im\phi}$.

Here is the constraint. For a wave function to be single-valued — for $\psi(\phi)$ to equal $\psi(\phi + 2\pi)$ — we need $e^{im \cdot 2\pi} = 1$, which forces $m$ to be an integer. Since the ladder of $m$-values runs from $-\ell$ to $+\ell$ in unit steps, $\ell$ must also be a non-negative integer. Half-integer orbital angular momentum is excluded by single-valuedness on the sphere. The algebra permits $\ell = 1/2$; the geometry of $S^2$ does not.

This is the structural divide between orbital and spin angular momentum. Orbital lives on function spaces over the sphere; integer only. Spin lives on a separate finite-dimensional complex vector space with no spatial interpretation; half-integer is allowed there because the single-valuedness constraint never applies.

The first few spherical harmonics, for orientation:

$$Y_{0,0} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{4\pi}}, \qquad Y_{1,0} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4\pi}}\cos\theta, \qquad Y_{1,\pm 1} = \mp\sqrt{\frac{3}{8\pi}}\sin\theta\,e^{\pm i\phi}.$$

![Polar plots of |Y_{ℓm}(θ,φ)|² for ℓ = 0](images/07-angular-momentum-fig-02.png)
*Figure 7.2 — Polar plots of |Y_{ℓm}(θ,φ)|² for ℓ = 0*

One thing worth saying about the chemists' $p$ orbitals, because the confusion is universal. The familiar $p_x$ and $p_y$ orbitals are real-valued combinations of $Y_{1,\pm 1}$:

$$p_x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(Y_{1,-1} - Y_{1,1}), \qquad p_y = \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}}(Y_{1,-1} + Y_{1,1}).$$

Only $p_z = Y_{1,0}$ is an eigenstate of $\hat{L}_z$ (with eigenvalue 0). The real combinations $p_x$ and $p_y$ are *not* $\hat{L}_z$ eigenstates — they are equal-weight superpositions of $m = +1$ and $m = -1$. Chemists use the real basis because it gives dumbbell-shaped orbitals that can be drawn clearly and that point along specific bond axes. Physicists working in magnetic fields use the complex $Y_{\ell m}$ basis because $\hat{L}_z$ is what the magnetic field couples to. Both are valid; they are different bases for the same subspace. The lesson is that a basis choice is not a physical statement about the state.

## Spin-1/2 and the Pauli matrices

Spin operators satisfy the same algebra:

$$[\hat{S}_x, \hat{S}_y] = i\hbar\hat{S}_z, \quad \text{and cyclically.}$$

The derivation of the previous section applies verbatim. For spin-1/2 specifically, the smallest non-trivial representation of this algebra is on a two-dimensional complex space, with $s = 1/2$ and $m_s = \pm 1/2$.

Write $\hat{S}_i = (\hbar/2)\sigma_i$. The **Pauli matrices** are:

$$\sigma_x = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \sigma_z = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}.$$

Four properties carry all the load:

1. $\sigma_i^2 = I$.
2. $\mathrm{Tr}(\sigma_i) = 0$.
3. Anticommutation: $\{\sigma_i, \sigma_j\} = 2\delta_{ij}I$.
4. Commutation: $[\sigma_i, \sigma_j] = 2i\epsilon_{ijk}\sigma_k$.

Properties 3 and 4 combine into $\sigma_i\sigma_j = \delta_{ij}I + i\epsilon_{ijk}\sigma_k$. The Pauli matrices are not magic — they are the simplest non-trivial matrices satisfying the angular-momentum algebra in two dimensions. In the $\hat{S}_z$ basis, the eigenstates are

$$|\uparrow\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad |\downarrow\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix},$$

and the eigenstates of $\hat{S}_x$ and $\hat{S}_y$ are

$$|+x\rangle = \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |+y\rangle = \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + i|\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-y\rangle = \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - i|\downarrow\rangle).$$

A spin prepared in $|+z\rangle$ and measured along $\hat{x}$ gives $\pm\hbar/2$ each with probability $1/2$, because $|\uparrow\rangle$ is a uniform superposition of $|+x\rangle$ and $|-x\rangle$. Knowing $S_z$ exactly tells you nothing about $S_x$. The Robertson bound from Chapter 5 with $[\hat{S}_x, \hat{S}_z] = -i\hbar\hat{S}_y$ says exactly this.

## The $720^\circ$ rotation: spinors are not vectors

Here is the deepest structural fact about spin. A classical vector in three-dimensional space returns to itself after a $360^\circ$ rotation. A spin-1/2 wave function does not.

Under a rotation by angle $\theta$ around axis $\hat{n}$, a spin-1/2 state transforms under

$$\hat{U}(\theta, \hat{n}) = \exp\!\left(-i\frac{\theta}{2}\hat{n}\cdot\vec{\sigma}\right).$$

The critical feature is the factor of $\theta/2$ — not $\theta$. Set $\theta = 2\pi$. Using $(\hat{n}\cdot\vec{\sigma})^2 = I$ and expanding the exponential:

$$\hat{U}(2\pi) = \cos\pi \cdot I - i\sin\pi\cdot(\hat{n}\cdot\vec{\sigma}) = -I.$$

A $360^\circ$ rotation sends every spin-1/2 state to its negative. The state returns to itself only after $720^\circ$. This is not a mathematical curiosity.

In 1975, Werner, Colella, Overhauser, and Eagen split a beam of neutrons, rotated one path by $2\pi$ using a magnetic field, and recombined the two paths in an interferometer. The interference pattern shifted by exactly $\pi$ — confirming that the rotated beam had acquired a minus sign relative to the unrotated beam. The same year, Rauch and collaborators confirmed it independently. A $360^\circ$ rotation changes the quantum state of a neutron in a way that is physically measurable. A $720^\circ$ rotation does not.

The language for this is: spin-1/2 lives in a spinor space that transforms under $\mathrm{SU}(2)$, the group of $2\times 2$ unitary matrices with unit determinant. This group is a *double cover* of the ordinary rotation group $\mathrm{SO}(3)$: two distinct $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ elements, $+I$ and $-I$, correspond to the same physical rotation. The factor of two in the exponential is the same factor of two in the $720^\circ$ story, and it has been confirmed in the laboratory.

This rules out any classical-rotation picture for spin. A classical spinning top returns to itself after $360^\circ$. Spin-1/2 does not. The behavior is not a quirk of the theory; it is measured.

## The singlet: two spins, one state, and the bridge to Bell

Two spin-1/2 particles. Total Hilbert space dimension: $2 \times 2 = 4$. The algebra tells us the total angular momentum takes values $j \in \{0, 1\}$, giving $1 + 3 = 4$ states — one singlet and one triplet.

Build them from the ladder operators. Start at the top: the state with both spins up has total $\hat{S}_z$ eigenvalue $+\hbar$, so

$$|1, +1\rangle = |\uparrow\uparrow\rangle.$$

Apply the total lowering operator $\hat{S}_- = \hat{S}_{1-} + \hat{S}_{2-}$. For a single spin-1/2, $\hat{S}_-|\uparrow\rangle = \hbar|\downarrow\rangle$ and $\hat{S}_-|\downarrow\rangle = 0$. So:

$$\hat{S}_-|\uparrow\uparrow\rangle = \hbar|\downarrow\uparrow\rangle + \hbar|\uparrow\downarrow\rangle.$$

The general lowering formula gives $\hat{S}_-|1,+1\rangle = \hbar\sqrt{2}\,|1,0\rangle$. Setting these equal:

$$|1, 0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\downarrow\rangle + |\downarrow\uparrow\rangle).$$

One more step down gives $|1, -1\rangle = |\downarrow\downarrow\rangle$. The triplet is:

$$|1, +1\rangle = |\uparrow\uparrow\rangle, \qquad |1, 0\rangle = \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\downarrow\rangle + |\downarrow\uparrow\rangle), \qquad |1, -1\rangle = |\downarrow\downarrow\rangle.$$

The singlet has $j = 0$, so $m = 0$. It lives in the $m = 0$ subspace spanned by $\{|\uparrow\downarrow\rangle, |\downarrow\uparrow\rangle\}$. By orthogonality to $|1, 0\rangle$, it must be the other linear combination in that subspace:

$$|0, 0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\downarrow\rangle - |\downarrow\uparrow\rangle).$$

Quick check: $\hat{S}_z|0,0\rangle = 0$ (trivial, the two terms cancel). For $\hat{S}^2$, use $\hat{S}^2 = \hat{S}_1^2 + \hat{S}_2^2 + 2\hat{S}_1\cdot\hat{S}_2$ and verify $\hat{S}^2|0,0\rangle = 0$ — confirming $j = 0$.

The singlet has three properties worth naming slowly.

**First: antisymmetry.** Swapping particles 1 and 2 sends $|\uparrow\downarrow\rangle \to |\downarrow\uparrow\rangle$ and vice versa, so $|0,0\rangle \to -|0,0\rangle$. The triplet states are symmetric under exchange. The singlet is antisymmetric. This is the seed of the spin-statistics theorem, which Chapter 8 develops.

**Second: rotational invariance.** Apply the same rotation to both spins: $|0,0\rangle$ is unchanged, up to overall phase. The singlet is the unique state in the two-particle space that is invariant under all simultaneous rotations. This is a direct consequence of $j = 0$ — a state of total angular momentum zero looks the same from every direction.

**Third: maximal entanglement.** The singlet cannot be written as a product $|\alpha\rangle_1|\beta\rangle_2$ for any choice of single-spin states. The two particles have no individual spin state; they have only a joint state. Measure $S_z$ on particle 1 and get $+\hbar/2$: particle 2 is then in $|\downarrow\rangle$ with certainty. Measure $S_z$ on particle 1 and get $-\hbar/2$: particle 2 is in $|\uparrow\rangle$. Perfect anti-correlation.

So far this could be classical — like a pair of gloves separated into two boxes, each definite but unknown until observed. The non-classical part is the rotational invariance. Because the singlet has the same form in every basis, the same perfect anti-correlation holds for $S_x$, $S_y$, or any axis $\hat{n}$: the two outcomes are always opposite. Verify: writing $|0,0\rangle$ in the $|+x\rangle, |-x\rangle$ basis gives $(1/\sqrt{2})(|+x\rangle_1|-x\rangle_2 - |-x\rangle_1|+x\rangle_2)$. Perfect anti-correlation along $\hat{x}$, not just $\hat{z}$.

![Two-particle singlet measurement schematic ](images/07-angular-momentum-fig-03.png)
*Figure 7.3 — Two-particle singlet measurement schematic *

The question Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen raised in 1935 is: does each particle "carry" a pre-existing definite value for $S_z$, $S_x$, and every other direction simultaneously — values that the measurement merely reveals? David Bohm reformulated their argument in terms of the spin singlet in 1951, making it more tractable. John Bell answered it in 1964 with an inequality: if pre-existing definite values exist, the correlations between measurements on the two particles must satisfy a certain bound. Quantum mechanics, via the singlet, predicts a violation of that bound. Experiment has confirmed the violation repeatedly. Chapter 10 does the full calculation. What this chapter has done is build the state on which the argument rests. Now you know where $|0,0\rangle$ came from, what its three properties mean, and why it cannot be reduced to anything simpler.

## What the algebra has built

The derivation ran as follows. From $[\hat{L}_x, \hat{L}_y] = i\hbar\hat{L}_z$ alone — no coordinates, no wave functions — we showed that $\hat{L}^2$ has eigenvalues $\hbar^2\ell(\ell+1)$ and $\hat{L}_z$ has eigenvalues $m\hbar$ ranging from $-\ell$ to $+\ell$ in unit steps, with $\ell$ an integer or half-integer. The $(\ell+1)$ factor came from the cross-term in $\hat{L}_-\hat{L}_+$; the boundedness of $m$ came from the non-negativity of $\hat{L}_x^2 + \hat{L}_y^2$. Single-valuedness on the sphere removed the half-integers for orbital angular momentum. The Pauli matrices gave the half-integer representation explicitly. The singlet state followed from the ladder operators applied to two spin-1/2 particles, by orthogonality.

The same algebraic skeleton — commutation relations, ladder operators, bounded spectrum — appears in the harmonic oscillator (Chapter 4), in the hydrogen atom (Chapter 6), and in quantum field theory where the same $\hat{a}_\pm$ algebra creates and destroys particles. Learning it once, here, in the context of angular momentum where the physical meaning is most transparent, is the investment that pays dividends for the rest of the course.

The student who asked the right question in office hours now has the answer. The letter $\ell$ does three jobs because it comes from one piece of algebra — the bounded-spectrum argument applied to the ladder operators — and that one piece of algebra simultaneously determines the $\hat{L}^2$ eigenvalue, the label on the state, and the range of $m$. They are not three coincidences. They are one result.

## Exercises

**Warm-up**

**W1.** Compute $[\hat{L}_y, \hat{L}_z]$ explicitly from $\hat{L}_y = \hat{z}\hat{p}_x - \hat{x}\hat{p}_z$ and $\hat{L}_z = \hat{x}\hat{p}_y - \hat{y}\hat{p}_x$, using only $[\hat{x}_i, \hat{p}_j] = i\hbar\delta_{ij}$. Show that the result equals $i\hbar\hat{L}_x$. Run every step — do not cite the cyclic argument without verifying it. *(The cyclic pattern is correct, but the student who has only been told it exists will miss why it holds for the second commutator as well as the first.)*

**W2.** A spin-1/2 particle is prepared in $|\uparrow\rangle = |+z\rangle$. Compute the probabilities of the two outcomes $\pm\hbar/2$ when $\hat{S}_x$ is measured. Then: after the $|+x\rangle$ output is selected, compute the probabilities when $\hat{S}_z$ is measured again. What has happened to the original $z$-spin information, and why? *(Direct application of Born rule plus collapse; the answer to "what happened" requires naming the non-commutativity of $\hat{S}_x$ and $\hat{S}_z$.)*

**W3.** Verify directly that $p_x = (Y_{1,-1} - Y_{1,1})/\sqrt{2}$ is not an eigenstate of $\hat{L}_z$. Compute $\langle p_x | \hat{L}_z | p_x \rangle$ and $\langle p_x | \hat{L}_z^2 | p_x \rangle$. What do the two numbers tell you about the outcome distribution of a $\hat{L}_z$ measurement on an electron in the $p_x$ orbital? *(Tests whether the student can work with linear combinations of spherical harmonics rather than treating them as isolated states.)*

**Application**

**A1.** Using $\sigma_i\sigma_j = \delta_{ij}I + i\epsilon_{ijk}\sigma_k$, prove the identity $(\vec{a}\cdot\vec{\sigma})(\vec{b}\cdot\vec{\sigma}) = (\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b})I + i(\vec{a}\times\vec{b})\cdot\vec{\sigma}$ for arbitrary three-vectors $\vec{a}$, $\vec{b}$. Use this to compute $(\hat{n}\cdot\vec{\sigma})^2$ for a unit vector $\hat{n}$, and from that derive the rotation operator formula $\hat{U}(\theta, \hat{n}) = \cos(\theta/2)I - i\sin(\theta/2)\hat{n}\cdot\vec{\sigma}$. Then verify that $\hat{U}(2\pi, \hat{n}) = -I$ for any $\hat{n}$. *(Chains the Pauli identity through to the $720°$ result; a student who can do this owns the rotation operator.)*

**A2.** Show that the singlet state $|0,0\rangle = (1/\sqrt{2})(|\uparrow\downarrow\rangle - |\downarrow\uparrow\rangle)$ has the same form when expressed in the $|+x\rangle, |-x\rangle$ basis: $|0,0\rangle = (1/\sqrt{2})(|+x\rangle_1|-x\rangle_2 - |-x\rangle_1|+x\rangle_2)$, up to overall phase. Use this to compute the probability of each outcome pair $(\pm\hbar/2, \pm\hbar/2)$ when both particles are measured along $\hat{x}$. Confirm that the outcomes are perfectly anti-correlated. *(The calculation makes rotational invariance concrete rather than asserted; if the student can repeat it for $\hat{y}$, they are ready for Chapter 10.)*

**Synthesis**

**S1.** The ladder-operator derivation showed that $\ell$ can be an integer or half-integer, and that single-valuedness on the sphere excludes the half-integers for orbital angular momentum. Construct the analogous argument for spin: explain why the single-valuedness constraint does not apply to spin, and identify what Hilbert space spin-1/2 lives on instead of the function space $L^2(S^2)$. Then state clearly why both representations — integer $\ell$ for orbital, half-integer $s$ for spin — satisfy the same commutation relations $[\hat{J}_x, \hat{J}_y] = i\hbar\hat{J}_z$, and why this is sufficient for the eigenvalue spectrum derived in this chapter to apply to both. *(Forces the student to articulate the orbital/spin distinction in terms of representation theory rather than just memorizing that one is integer and the other is not.)*

**S2.** The triplet state $|1,0\rangle = (1/\sqrt{2})(|\uparrow\downarrow\rangle + |\downarrow\uparrow\rangle)$ and the singlet $|0,0\rangle = (1/\sqrt{2})(|\uparrow\downarrow\rangle - |\downarrow\uparrow\rangle)$ differ by a single sign. (a) Show that measuring $\hat{S}_z$ on each particle gives the same outcome distribution $\{(+\hbar/2,-\hbar/2), (-\hbar/2,+\hbar/2)\}$ each with probability $1/2$ for both states. (b) Show that measuring $\hat{S}_x$ on each particle gives anti-correlated outcomes for the singlet but correlated outcomes for $|1,0\rangle$. (c) What single experiment distinguishes the singlet from the $m=0$ triplet state? *(The sign difference is physically meaningful and can be detected; part (c) requires the student to identify which measurement axis reveals the distinction and why.)*

**Challenge**

**C1.** The derivation of this chapter showed that the eigenvalue of $\hat{L}^2$ is $\hbar^2\ell(\ell+1)$, not $\hbar^2\ell^2$. The difference comes from the commutator cross-term. Now ask the question in reverse: suppose you were told the eigenvalue is $\hbar^2\ell^2$ (no $(\ell+1)$ factor). What would have to be different about the angular momentum algebra for this to be true — specifically, what would have to be true about $[\hat{L}_x, \hat{L}_y]$? Describe the physical consequences: would the Robertson bound $\sigma_{L_x}\sigma_{L_y} \geq \tfrac{1}{2}|\langle[\hat{L}_x,\hat{L}_y]\rangle|$ still constrain simultaneous measurements, and would there still be a ladder structure? *(A counterfactual that forces the student to understand which feature of the algebra produces each feature of the spectrum, rather than treating the derivation as a black box.)*

## Prompts

Use these prompts with Claude to generate interactive D3 v7 versions of the
figures in this chapter. Each produces a standalone HTML file you can open
in a browser and modify freely.

**Prerequisites:** Load `brutalist/CLAUDE.md` and `brutalist/DESIGN.md` into
your Claude project context before using these prompts. They define the stack,
naming conventions, color system, and typography the figures use.

### Figure 7.1 — Ladder diagram showing m-values from −ℓ to +ℓ

Create a standalone D3 v7 HTML file for Figure Ladder diagram showing m-values from −ℓ to +ℓ. Use the CDN https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/d3/7.9.0/d3.min.js, inline CSS, ResizeObserver redraw, SVG role="img", aria-labelledby, title, and desc. Build the figure from this structural brief: ladder diagram showing m-values from −ℓ to +ℓ as horizontal rungs on a vertical ladder, with ↑ arrows labeled L̂₊ and ↓ arrows labeled L̂₋; the top rung labeled mₘₐₓ = ℓ with L̂₊|ℓ,ℓ⟩ = 0, and bottom rung mₘᵢₙ = −ℓ with L̂₋|ℓ,−ℓ⟩ = 0; student should see the bounded structure before the algebra proves it. Use the described data shape and labels; when exact values are not supplied, use plausible illustrative values that preserve the relationships in the brief. Use a zero baseline for bars or areas, direct labels where possible, and annotations named in the brief. Use only DESIGN.md color variables and the required serif/mono font split.

### Figure 7.2 — Polar plots of |Y_{ℓm}(θ,φ)|² for ℓ = 0

Create a standalone D3 v7 HTML file for Figure Polar plots of |Y_{ℓm}(θ,φ)|² for ℓ = 0. Use the CDN https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/d3/7.9.0/d3.min.js, inline CSS, ResizeObserver redraw, SVG role="img", aria-labelledby, title, and desc. Build the figure from this structural brief: polar plots of |Y_{ℓm}(θ,φ)|² for ℓ = 0 (sphere), ℓ = 1 m = 0 (dumbbell along z), and ℓ = 1 m = ±1 (torus around z) — student should see the azimuthal symmetry of m = ±1 and the z-axis preference of m = 0, and understand why the real p_x, p_y combinations point along x and y instead. Use the described data shape and labels; when exact values are not supplied, use plausible illustrative values that preserve the relationships in the brief. Use a zero baseline for bars or areas, direct labels where possible, and annotations named in the brief. Use only DESIGN.md color variables and the required serif/mono font split.

### Figure 7.3 — Two-particle singlet measurement schematic 

Create a standalone D3 v7 HTML file for Figure Two-particle singlet measurement schematic . Use the CDN https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/d3/7.9.0/d3.min.js, inline CSS, ResizeObserver redraw, SVG role="img", aria-labelledby, title, and desc. Build the figure from this structural brief: two-particle singlet measurement schematic — source in center emitting two particles in opposite directions, each particle heading toward a Stern–Gerlach apparatus whose orientation can be rotated; labels showing that whatever axis Alice measures, Bob's outcome is always opposite; the rotational freedom of the detectors is what makes the Bell argument possible. Use the described data shape and labels; when exact values are not supplied, use plausible illustrative values that preserve the relationships in the brief. Use a zero baseline for bars or areas, direct labels where possible, and annotations named in the brief. Use only DESIGN.md color variables and the required serif/mono font split.
